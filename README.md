Movie Database v1.0
A minor side note before the instructison: (Instructions in Readme.txt
in the Movie Database v1.0 folder)
This project was written over the course of 2 months, mostly during my
WinterBreak between my Junior and Senior year while attending SUNY Albany.
It is written in Java but also includes usage of new JAR's and techniques 
including:

	SQLite Database
	JSON API
	Lambda Expressions
	UML Documentary
	Storyboard
	Design Docs
	HashMaps
The best way to learn is by doing! Also I wanted to take a second to 
dedicate this project to my beautiful, smart, funny wife Becky, who 
supported me through this whole project. Now on to the instructions and 
overview.

This program is a simple Movie database that takes advantage of the IMDB 
Database, via the OMDB.com API. It also allows custom movies and artwork
to be saved.

Also most of the source code is JAVA, uploading the UML Documentation 
required a LOT of HTML, but none of it was written by myself.

Future wishlist:
	Change order of movies by drag an drop
	Detect duplicates
	Get movies based on certain critera
	Video game support
	Import and Export database
	And much more!
